SUMMARY="A simple Japanese kana (Hiragana and Katakana) drill tool"
DESCRIPTION="Kanatest is a Japanese kana (hiragana and katakana) simple flashcard tool. It offers
fourteen lessons and three drill modes: hiragana, katakana, and mixed mode. The tool displays
randomly selected kana characters (respecting mode and lesson) and waits for the user answer
(expected as the romaji equivalent). This process continues until all questions are answered or all
questions are answered correctly (depending on options). At the end of test, information about
drilling time and correctness ratio is displayed. The results are stored, and a user can review his
performance at any time."
