SUMMARY="GObject Builder"
DESCRIPTION="
GObject Builder is a simple preprocessor for easily creating GObject objects.
It does not parse any C code and ignores any C errors.
It is in spirit similar to things like lex or yacc. In some ways it also resembles java.
But it is really just a simple preprocessor for creating GObjects for use in C or C++ and
it is not a programming language.
